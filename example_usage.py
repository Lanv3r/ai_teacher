    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. 
    There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
    Supervised learning uses labeled training data to make predictions. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labels. 
    Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
